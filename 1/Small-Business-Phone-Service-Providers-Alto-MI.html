<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as organisations and entrepreneurs switch from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. There is a substantial variety of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than standard telephone systems providers. The hardware and software is cost-efficient, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, wireless "hot spots" in areas such as airports, cafes, and parks allow you to connect to the Internet and might enable you to utilize VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
<p>Multi-line telephone systems, including 2-line business phone systems and 4-line phone systems, are developed to permit several people to be on the phone at the same time.
