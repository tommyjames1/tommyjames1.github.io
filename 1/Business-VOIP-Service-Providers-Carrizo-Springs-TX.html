<p>Still, with a lot option readily available, and with so much jargon surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be tough to understand where to begin. While Digital Phone Systems are convenient and practical; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business must comply with security policies that need data to be saved on-site, then a hosted option is probably not the best service.

Instead of using telephone lines, VoIP utilizes SIP trunks (SIP stands for session initiation protocol).</p>
